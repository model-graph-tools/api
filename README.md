# API 

The API is a microservice which performs several tasks:

- Registry for the [model](https://github.com/model-graph-tools/model) services (backed by a redis database)
- Single point of contact and proxy for the [browser](https://github.com/model-graph-tools/browser)
- Compute differences of a resource between two versions of the management model

## Big Picture

Take a look at the [setup](https://github.com/model-graph-tools/setup) repository how to get started.
